Career Crawler

Coded by: Andrew Raisbeck

This software searches and indexes job postings across LinkedIn, Workopolous, and Monster; 
You can review the postings by double clicking them, right click to assign a "Cover Letter Style"
from a previous application, or click "New Style" at the bottom of the window to create a new custom
Cover Letter Style (style refers to the main body paragraph of the Cover Letter... the rest
is filled in with data scraped from the postings webpage.

More info will be updated here as time progresses; this is by no means a legitimate README, and this
software has not been finished yet!

CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY:

	- Fully functional for Monster.ca job postings
	
TO DO:

	- Still need to implement Adaptor classes for Workopolous and LinkedIn... coming very soon.
	

							**NOTICE: To Prospective Employers**

If you are reading this, thank you for taking the time to look at my work. Please note that - due
to time restrictions - this code is not fully representative of my "Style" and "Commenting" skill
(Readability); this code is intended to exemplify my problem solving and programming skill. I have
included this for your review as I realize that I am a recent graduate, and likely do not meet your
expectations in terms of "Years of Experience". Hopefully, this gives you an idea of how much I
enjoy my field of discipline, and the kind of motivation, enthusiasm, and skill I can bring to
your company if I am hired.
