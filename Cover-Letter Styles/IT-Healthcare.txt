The past two summers, I worked for York Region Emergency Medical Services - and Long-Term Care - providing local systems support; I was responsible for: making sure the computer systems on the ambulances were functioning; providing support for employees at various stations/offices; troubleshooting issues with various patient and health related applications. While I was there, I also worked with the payroll department and developed some software that they now use to automate some of their more time-consuming tasks. This position - along with the mandatory PHIPA training that I completed there - gave me valuable experience and insight that I believe make me a top candidate for this position.
