The previous positions I held at Direct Energy and the Regional Municipality of York have given me both excellent troubleshooting and customer service skills; Direct Energy in particular was an extremely fast-paced environment, and I consistently was the top performing help desk analyst. This job required me to solve critical IT-related problems both over phone and in person, and also coordinate with many specialized departments throughout the company. On top of this, my strong programming skills I developed in University (and continue to use) are an extremely valuable asset for a job like this, and I am very comfortable troubleshooting both Microsoft and Unix systems.
