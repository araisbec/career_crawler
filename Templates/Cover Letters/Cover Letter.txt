To Whom It May Concern:

I would like to apply for the Service Desk Technician position – as listed on Monster.ca - at The Ian Martin Group. Along with this letter, I have attached my current resume for your review. As a recent university graduate with one year of work experience in the IT industry, I am more than confident that I have the skills to become a valuable, hardworking asset to your company.
The previous positions I held at Direct Energy and the Regional Municipality of York have given me both excellent troubleshooting and customer service skills; Direct Energy in particular was an extremely fast-paced (mostly over phone) environment, and I consistently was the top performing help desk analyst. On top of this, my strong programming skills I developed in University (and continue to use) are an extremely valuable asset for a job like this, and I am very comfortable troubleshooting both Microsoft and Unix systems.
I very much appreciate your taking the time to consider myself for a position. If you have any questions at all, please call me at (905) 898-1760. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Sincerely,
Andrew Raisbeck
