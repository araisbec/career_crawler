My education at the University of Guelph (Bachelor of Computing) was highly centered around both the object oriented paradigm, as well as the fundamental principles used to develop (and debug) code from the ground up; the main languages with which we were taught this were Java, Python, and C. I have also utilized these skills for web development (at High Speed Hockey), scripting, and full software development (at The Regional Municipality of York).
